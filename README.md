# Travel Itinerary
## Background üèû
This application was inspired by people in my family who are in the travel business. More so for an app that my family could use, for any future family trips.

This CRUD application was developed using RESTful architecture principles and MEN stack technologies (MongoDB, ExpressJS & Node.js)

## Application Details üìù
Upon starting the application, they will be in the main page of the site where the tables would be updated, before logging in with Google OAuth.

Once a user has logged in with Google OAuth, they will be brought to an index view of all flights and hotels they might have added. If user already has flights in the table they can check the details about that flight. If you want to create a new flight then you can click the `New Flight` button on the navigation bar. Once clicked you will be in a new page where you will be adding the airline, airport, flight number, and departure date. After that you click on `Add flight` button. You will then be redirected to the index view. From there you can click on the `Details` and then be redirected to the flights details page. Once on the page the user can look at your nav bar and see a new a new section on there called Edit flight. After the user can click on that you can edit the flights details and change the information user added when you created a new flight. The user will then click `Save Flight`, the user will be redirected to the flights details page. Where you can see the details but also add destination and tickets. Adding the destination can be done on the details page and destinations can also be deleted in that page my clicking the `Delete` button. Also you can add a ticket and details in a separate page. In that tickets page you can add the seat details, price, and flight number.

## Icebox Features üßä
While this application accomplishes some user-functionality, there are a number of icebox features which will be added as availability permits. Here are some of the future upgrades...

- If the hotel and flight are in the same destination then they will be combined together.

- To combined flights which are part of a layover or connecting flight for the user

- Also to compile any hotel chains that the user in stay at which might be in different locations.
